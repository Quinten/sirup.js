# sirupjs

A small library that only implements those features of jQuery you need to build simple css transition slide shows.

The idea is inspired by the article [Getting over jQuery](http://ponyfoo.com/articles/getting-over-jquery) by [Nicolas Bevacqua](https://github.com/bevacqua)

## Already implemented

get : get the set of matched elements

ready : check if the dom is ready

addClass : add a css class

removeClass : remove a class

hasClass : checks to see if the first element has a class

toggleClass : toggles a class

## Todo

click : we are gonna want some interaction

each : loop over elements

index : get the index of the element in the parent

wrap an element in a sirup object
