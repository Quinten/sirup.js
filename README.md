# sirupjs

A small library that only implements those features of jQuery you need to build simple css transition slideshows.

The idea is inspired by the article [Getting over jQuery](http://ponyfoo.com/articles/getting-over-jquery) by [Nicolas Bevacqua](https://github.com/bevacqua)

## the set of features are

get : get the set or nodeList of matched elements

each : loop over elements

ready : check if the dom is ready

addClass : add a css class

removeClass : remove a class

hasClass : checks to see if the first element has a class

toggleClass : toggles a class

click : we are gonna want some interaction

You can pass an element or a css selector to the sirup function.

Most sirup functions can be chained.
